        <h1>What is Football?</h1>
        <p>
          Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is a popular sport
          played and enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. It is a team sport
          that involves two teams competing to score goals by getting a ball
          into the opposing team's net. The game is played on a rectangular
          field with goalposts at each end, and players use their feet (and
          sometimes other parts of their bodies) to control and pass the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
          Football is not just a game; it's a passion that brings people
          together, fostering a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. From local
          matches to international competitions, football has the power to unite
          fans and create unforgettable moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a player on the field or a passionate supporter in the
          stands, football is a sport that transcends borders and cultures,
          creating a global community bound by the love of the game.

        <h1>Basics of Football</h1>
        <h3>1. The Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The primary objective of football is to score goals by getting the
          ball into the opponent's net. Each goal is worth one point, and the
          team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Teams and Players</h3>
        <p>
          A standard football match is played between two teams, each consisting
          of 11 players, including one goalkeeper. Players are not allowed to
          use their hands or arms to touch the ball, except for the goalkeeper
          within their penalty area.
        </p>

        <h3>3. The Pitch</h3>
        <p>
          The game is played on a rectangular field, known as the pitch, with
          goalposts at each end. The pitch is divided into two halves, and each
          team defends one half while trying to score in the opponent's half.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Offsides</h3>
        <p>
          The offside rule is in place to ensure fair play. A player is
          considered offside if they are nearer to the opponent's goal line than
          the ball and the second-to-last defender when the ball is played to
          them.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Fouls and Free Kicks</h3>
        <p>
          Fouls occur when a player engages in unfair play, such as tripping,
          pushing, or handball. The opposing team is awarded a free kick or a
          penalty kick, depending on the severity and location of the foul.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Yellow and Red Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Referees may issue yellow cards for caution and red cards for serious
          offenses. A player receiving a red card is sent off the field, and
          their team plays with one player fewer for the remainder of the match.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Understanding and following these rules is essential for players,
          coaches, and fans alike to appreciate the beauty of the game and
          ensure a fair and competitive playing environment.
